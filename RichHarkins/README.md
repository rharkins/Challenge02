Cash Register

Write a change machine that, given a U.S. currency value, determines the FEWEST number of bills and coins to return for change, listing out the exact change.
 Assume $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 bills and penny, nickel, dime, quarter coins for the denominations.
  
 Here are some examples:
 5.27 -> 1 $5 bill, 1 quarter, 2 pennies
 10 -> 1 $10 bill
 30 -> 1 $20 bill, 1 $10 bill
